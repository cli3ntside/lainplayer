# lainplayer
lain themed ascii style music player i made for fun. <br />

all you need to do for it to work is install any version of python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads) and launch start.bat <br />
the keybinds are pretty self explanatory. you can easily add ur own music by adding / deleting files from the bin folder
